# Week 01 Introduction to Graph Algorithm
# Module: 01 Introduction to Algorithm and Graph Theory 
## What is Algorithm? 
a process or set of rules to be followed in calculations or other problem-solving operations, especially by a computer.

## Introduction to Graphs: Node and Edge
   What is Graph?
   Graph algorithms are a set of instructions that traverse (visits nodes of a) graph. Some algorithms are used to find a specific node or the path between two given nodes.

    Components of a Graph
        Vertices/Nodes: Vertices are the fundamental units of the graph. Sometimes, vertices are also known as vertex or nodes. Every node/vertex can be labeled or unlabelled.   
   
    Edges: Edges are drawn or used to connect two nodes of the graph. It can be ordered pair of nodes in a directed graph. Edges can connect any two nodes in any possible way. There are no rules. Sometimes, edges are also known as arcs. Every edge can be labeled/unlabelled.
       

    Variations of Graph
        = Unwighted Graph
            An unweighted graph is a graph in which the edges do not have weights or costs associated with them. Instead, they simply represent the presence of a connection between two vertices.

        = Weighted Graph

        = Directed Graph


        = Undirected Graph

        = Bipartitc Graph
        A graph G = (V, E) is said to be a bipartite graph if its vertex set V(G) can be partitioned into two non-empty disjoint subsets. V1(G) and V2(G) in such a way that each edge e of E(G) has one end in V1(G) and another end in V2(G). The partition V1 U V2 = V is called Bipartite of G. Here in the figure: V1(G)={V5, V4, V3} and V2(G)={V1, V2}

        = Complete Graph
            A simple graph with n vertices is called a complete graph if the degree of each vertex is n-1, that is, one vertex is attached with n-1 edges or the rest of the vertices in the graph. A complete graph is also called Full Graph.
