    - Algorithms
    What's Algorithm?
    = a process or set of rules to be followed in calculations or other         problem-solving operations, especially by a computer

    - What is Graph?
    = A graph in this context is made up of vertices (also called nodes or points) which are connected by edges (also called links or lines). A distinction is made between undirected graphs, where edges link two vertices symmetrically, and directed graphs, where edges link two vertices asymmetrically.

    * Nodes and Edge.


    - Variations of Graph
        = Unwighted Graph
        = Weighted Graph

        = Directed Graph
        = Undirected Graph

        = Bipartitc Graph

        = Complete Graph

        = Tree Graph
        {No Cycle}
        {Path onece visited}

        = Tree
            - Rooted Tree
            - Unrooted Tree

        = DAG
            - Directed Acyclic Graph

        = Multi Edge
        = Self Loop
